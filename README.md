This assignment focuses on the concept of multithreading.
It is common in modern programming to have a program running multiple threads to solve a problem. In this assignment you will compare the performance of a single-threaded program and multi-threaded program to copy a text file (a text file is not just a file that ends in .txt but any file that contains text, such as source code).
